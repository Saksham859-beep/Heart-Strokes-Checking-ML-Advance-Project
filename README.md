# Heart-Strokes-Checking-ML-Advance-Project
This project aims to build a Machine Learning model that predicts the likelihood of a stroke based on clinical and lifestyle factors. Using a real-world medical dataset, the model analyzes key features such as age, hypertension, heart disease, glucose levels, BMI, smoking status, and more to identify patterns that contribute to stroke risk.
