# Heart-Strokes-Checking-ML-Advance-Project
This project aims to build a Machine Learning model that predicts the likelihood of a stroke based on clinical and lifestyle factors. Using a real-world medical dataset, the model analyzes key features such as age, hypertension, heart disease, glucose levels, BMI, smoking status, and more to identify patterns that contribute to stroke risk.
✨ Key Features

📊 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, feature scaling.
🤖 Model Training: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and other ML algorithms.
🏆 Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
🔍 Feature Importance Analysis to understand major stroke risk contributors.
📈 Visualizations: Heatmaps, Pairplots, Correlation matrix, and model performance graphs.
🚀 Final Stroke Prediction Model saved using Pickle/Joblib for deployment.

🎯 Objective
To develop a reliable ML system that helps predict stroke risk early, assisting in preventive healthcare and awareness.
🔧 Technologies Used
